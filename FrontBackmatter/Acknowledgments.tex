I sincerely thank Professor Shoja'eddin Chenouri of the Department of Statistics \& Actuarial Science and the Statistical Consulting and Collaborative Research Unit for his extensive support and guidance in the development of a rigorous Bayesian inference approach to geometry reconstruction. I regret not being bright enough to see the project through to the end.

% Jim: for helpful discussions and
I would also like to thank Professor James Martin for his extensive support and mentorship over the past few years.

% Marcel: for originally proposing the idea of using a lookup table
I thank Professor Marcel Nooijen for originally proposing the idea of using a lookup table to reconstruct molecular geometries which started this research project.

I would like to thank everyone involved in the production of the television series \emph{The Wire} and \emph{Breaking Bad} for providing excellent and thoughtful procrastination material, without which this thesis would have been finished earlier, but with less thought and less one reference.

Part of this work was made possible by the high-performance computing facilities and the support staff of the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network (SHARCNET: \href{www.sharcnet.ca}{www.sharcnet.ca}) and Compute Canada.

I gratefully acknowledge financial support provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) through their Undergraduate Student Research Awards (USRA) Program and Canada Graduate Scholarships Master's (CGS M) Program.

Ultimately, I would like to sincerely thank the Canadian taxpayers for their investment in scientific research in these tough economic times, which has funded my research and education on multiple occasions. I hope I will be able to (and I plan to) do more to give back in the future.
