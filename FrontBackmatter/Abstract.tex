\chapter*{Abstract}
Coulomb explosion imaging is a technique of imaging the structure of small molecules in the gas phase and their ultrafast dynamics by inducing the rapid ionization and dissociation of the molecule into its constituent atomic fragments. The momentum vectors of the atomic fragments facilitate the retreival of the molecule's structure, however, few attempts at geometry reconstruction appear in the published literature, whose vague methodology casts serious doubts on the geometry reconstructions that have been performed and motivating the need for an investigation into the feasibility of geometry reconstruction. We develop a method for the fast and precise reconstruction of triatomic molecular geometries by casting the task as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. However, the result of further investigation suggests that geometry reconstruction using Coulomb explosion imaging is unfeasible due to the high sensitivity of the process with respect to uncertainty in the momentum vectors and the existence of multiple solutions, or degenerate geometries, for a wide range of geometries.
