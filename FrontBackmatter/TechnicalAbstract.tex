\chapter*{Abstract}
Ever since the early days of Coulomb explosion imaging, the direct imaging of the structure and dynamics of individual molecules has been promised; however, in practice no one has been able to accurately retrieve this structure and all imaging relies on plotting the momentum vectors of the fragments in different ways to infer crude changes in geometry. The momentum vectors tell a large part of the story but do not provide a clear picture of the molecular dynamics everyone seeks so an accurate method of retrieving the structure is highly desirable. I use Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to elucidate the molecular geometries, allowing for the study of larger systems than before and for the inclusion of measurement error in these studies for the first time. Using this method, the ultrafast isomerization of carbonyl sulfide and acetylene is imaged in position-space and showcased as a molecular movie. The method, however, is much larger in scope and is generalized to any problem involving a physical system described by a system of ordinary differential equations, where the final conditions are experimentally measured and inference of the initial conditions is desirable.
