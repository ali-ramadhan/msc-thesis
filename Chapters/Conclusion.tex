We have shown that geometry reconstruction can be done 

\section*{Infeasibility of geometry reconstruction}
We have found multiple barriers to accurate geometry reconstruction. Firstly, that geometry reconstruction is highly sensitive to uncertainties in the momentum vectors, means that .

If the initial momentum of each atomic fragment can be measured, then the 
We dealt with a highly ideal case
