\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}

To image the dynamics of a molecule by destroying it seems paradoxical. As we shall see, the molecule's structure is encoded in the atmoic shrapnel left behind after an explosion. However, to destroy one of nature's simplest creations is no easy task. Molecules are held together by strong chemical bonds. Our best line of attach is to shoot them with a short laser pulse---engulfing the molecule in an intense oscillating electric field will strip away its electrons and cause it to break up quickly. In these first few chapters, I will discuss how to create a short laser pulse and how these pulses interact with matter. Then I will introduce the technique of pump-probe Coulomb explosion imaging, which we will use to probe the dynamic structure of small molecules by studying the atomic fragments resulting from the explosion.
