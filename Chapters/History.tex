It is easy to get stuck in the ivory tower and get lost within the trees of science, losing sight of the big picture of where your research leads.

% \subsection{The first movies}
Molecular movies are of course not only of interest in physics and chemistry as a means of probing fundamental processes, but also in the biological sciences where molecular structure play a crucial role in determining the function of biomolecules such as proteins. However, the molecules of interest there are much too large to be studied by any of the previous techniques. Thus molecular movies in the biological sciences tend to be annotated computer simulations amalgamated from multiple studies. That said, they are very impressive pieces of work.

A particularly impressive movie by \citet{Cheung12} showcases the process of RNA polymerase transcription and goes on for over six minutes.
