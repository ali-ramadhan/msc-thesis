Theorems can easily be defined

\begin{definition}
  Let $f$ be a function whose derivative exists in every point, then $f$ is 
  a continuous function.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
  \label{pythagorean}
  This is a theorema about right triangles and can be summarised in the next 
  equation 
  \[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of a right triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$, arranged inside a square with side $c$ as in the top half of the diagram. The triangles are similar with area $\tfrac12ab$, while the small square has side $b-a$ and area $(b-a)^2$. The area of the large square is therefore
  $$(b-a)^2+4\frac{ab}{2} = (b-a)^2+2ab = a^2+b^2$$  
  But this is a square with side $c$ and area $c^2$, so $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.
\end{proof}

And a consequence of theorem \ref{pythagorean} is the statement in the next 
corollary.
